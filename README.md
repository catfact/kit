### kit

grab-bag reference collection of techniques, templates, POCs, mostly in C/C++. not particularly exciting or diffifult but useful to remember.

much of this code is specific to POSIX/linux, though there are some cross-platform frameworks used as well (JUCE, SDL, &c.)

much of this code is copied verbatim from tutorials and so on, so includes various licenses and styles.

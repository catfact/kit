### kit

this repository is a sort of grab-bag reference collection of techniques and templates, mostly in C/C++. none of it is particularly exciting or difficult, just included here as an aid to my memory.

much of this code is specific to POSIX/linux, though there are some cross-platform frameworks used as well (JUCE, SDL, &c.)

much of this code is copied verbatim from tutorials and so on, so includes various licenses and styles.
